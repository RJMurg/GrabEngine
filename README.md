# GrabEngine

GrabEngine polls the Irish Rail network through TrackEngine every minute.
Irish Rail does not have an easily consumable list of every route on its network. GrabEngine seeks to solve this by pulling the list of all Trains on the Irish Rail network every minute.
This data will eventually be used to create and update a list of all routes, as well as storing historic punctuality metrics.
